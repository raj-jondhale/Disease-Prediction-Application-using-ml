The Disease Prediction Application is a machine learning-based system developed to predict the
likelihood of specific diseases based on user inputs. The application utilizes pre-trained machine learning
models for diabetes prediction, heart disease prediction, and Parkinson's disease prediction. Users can
provide their demographic information, medical history, and lifestyle factors through an interactive user
interface built using the Streamlit library.
